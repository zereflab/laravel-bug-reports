# Laravel Bug Reports

Organized Laravel exception reports for Slack.

This package replaces noisy default Slack log messages with a clean parent alert, a full threaded exception, duplicate throttling, and Slack buttons for `Solved` / `Ignore`.

## Features

- Laravel log channel integration
- Short parent Slack message with useful context
- Full exception and stack trace in the Slack thread
- Duplicate throttling by exception fingerprint
- `Solved` and `Ignore` Slack buttons
- One click updates every stored Slack message for the same error fingerprint
- Ignored fingerprints suppress future alerts
- Safe production behavior: Slack failures do not break your app
- Test command that fails loudly when Slack config is wrong
- Designed for future Discord support

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the package

```bash
composer require zereflab/laravel-bug-reports
```

### 2. Publish the config

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=bug-reports-config
```

### 3. Run the migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 4. Connect Slack

Install the pre-built **LaravelBugBot** Slack app into your workspace — no Slack app creation needed:

**[➡ Add to Slack](https://laravelbugbot.com/integrations/slack/install)**

```text
https://laravelbugbot.com/integrations/slack/install
```

After authorizing, you'll see your bot token and workspace details on screen. Paste them into your `.env`:

```env
LOG_CHANNEL=bug_reports

BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_APP_MODE=managed
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-generated-token
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_CHANNEL=C1234567890
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_ACTIONS_ENABLED=false
```

Use the channel ID (starts with `C`), not the channel name. To find it: open the channel in Slack, click its name, and scroll to the bottom of the About tab.

Then invite the bot to your channel in Slack:

```text
/invite @LaravelBugBot
```

> With the pre-built app, manage error statuses from the built-in dashboard (`BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_ACTIONS_ENABLED=false` hides the Slack buttons, which require your own Slack app).

### 5. Test your setup

```bash
php artisan bug-reports:test
```

You should see the test exception arrive in your Slack channel. That's it — every exception in your app now lands in Slack, organized.

## Want To Use Your Own Slack Application?

If you prefer to create and control your own Slack app (required for the Slack `Solved` / `Ignore` buttons), follow the separate guide:

**[➡ Use Your Own Slack App](docs/use-your-own-slack-app.md)**

## Environment Variables

Defaults shown below — override only what you need:

```env
BUG_REPORTS_REPORTER=slack
BUG_REPORTS_LOG_CHANNEL=bug_reports
BUG_REPORTS_CACHE_PREFIX=bug-reports
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_APP_MODE=own
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_INSTALL_URL=https://laravelbugbot.com/integrations/slack/install
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_USERNAME="${APP_NAME}"
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_EMOJI=:boom:
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_ACTIONS_ENABLED=true
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_IGNORE_TTL_DAYS=0
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_SOLVED_TTL_DAYS=7
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_STORED_MESSAGES=50
BUG_REPORTS_ROUTE_PREFIX=bug-reports
BUG_REPORTS_ROUTE_MIDDLEWARE=api
BUG_REPORTS_DASHBOARD_PATH=bugs-report
BUG_REPORTS_DASHBOARD_MIDDLEWARE=web,auth
BUG_REPORTS_DASHBOARD_GATE=viewBugReports
BUG_REPORTS_DASHBOARD_USER_IDS=
```

After changing config:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan config:cache
```

## What The Slack Alert Looks Like

Parent message:

- Date/time
- Log level
- Exception class
- Exact exception message
- Origin: command, job, controller, route action, or application class
- Entity/user/model information when detectable
- File and line
- `Solved` and `Ignore` buttons

Thread reply:

- Exception class
- Message
- Location
- Level
- Environment
- Request details when available
- Context
- Stack trace
- Previous exception when available

## Solved And Ignore

Each exception gets a fingerprint based on exception class, message, file, and line.

- `Ignore` suppresses future alerts for that same fingerprint.
- `Solved` marks the fingerprint as resolved and clears the throttle.
- Both actions update all stored parent messages for that same fingerprint.
- If a solved fingerprint happens again, it is reopened as pending.

Bug reports, occurrence counts, statuses, and Slack message references are stored in the database. By default, ignored errors are ignored forever. You can expire ignored errors:

```env
BUG_REPORTS_SLACK_IGNORE_TTL_DAYS=30
```

## Dashboard

The package includes a Horizon-style dashboard:

```text
https://your-domain.com/bugs-report
```

The dashboard shows:

- Total error fingerprints and total occurrences
- Errors received in the last 1, 5, 7, 10, and 30 days
- Pending, resolved, and ignored counts
- Noisiest origins and exception classes
- Paginated tables for all, pending, resolved, and ignored errors
- Resolve, ignore, and delete actions

Change the dashboard path:

```env
BUG_REPORTS_DASHBOARD_PATH=internal/bugs
```

Use Laravel middleware to protect it:

```env
BUG_REPORTS_DASHBOARD_MIDDLEWARE=web,auth
```

Authorize access with a gate:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;

Gate::define('viewBugReports', function (User $user) {
    return $user->is_admin;
});
```

Optionally allow specific user IDs to bypass the gate:

```env
BUG_REPORTS_DASHBOARD_USER_IDS=1,42
```

## Production Notes

Use this in production:

```env
APP_DEBUG=false
LOG_CHANNEL=bug_reports
BUG_REPORTS_LEVEL=error
BUG_REPORTS_THROTTLE_MINUTES=5
```

Do not use Laravel's default `slack` channel if you want this package's formatting. Use `bug_reports`.

## Future Discord Support

The package is structured around reporter drivers. Slack is the first reporter. Discord can be added later with the same fingerprinting, summary formatting, threaded/detail behavior where supported, and solved/ignore state.
